# Anchor Vault

This is yet another anchor vault project.

## Quick Start

Run the following commands:

`anchor build`

`anchor test`


Note: 

Once again, I know how to organize anchor apps (`lib.rs`, `instructions/`, `state/`, etc.), but this project has a simplified structure compared to more complex Anchor applications (like lotteries, IDOs, AMMs).
